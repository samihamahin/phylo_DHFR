## Phylogenetic Analysis of Dihydrofolate reductase

# Background

## Dihydrofoloate Reductase Protein

Dihydrofoloate reductase (DHRF) is a reducing agent found in various different organisms. Its primary function is to use NADPH (e- donor) to reduce dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid. Tetrahydrofolic acid is then used to syntehsize certain purines, thymidylic acid, and amino acids.

It is composed of eight-stranded beta sheets connected to, and surrounded by, four alpha helices. The main active site contains a conserved Proline-Tryptophan sequence that is responsible for the actual reduction/binding of the additional hydrogen bond upon reduction.

The inhibition of Dihydrofoloate reductase has been associated with megaloblastic anemia, which comes as a result of foliate deficiency. Alternatively, the inhibition of DHRF can also be used as a potential cancer-reducing agent, since the lack of resources to produce folic acid could act as a cell-growth regulator in cancer cells.

## Dihydrofoloate Reductase Protein

The phylogenetic analysis of proteins such as DHRF can help us understand the evolutionary differences of said protein between different organisms, seeing how different sequences for the same protein aligns with the nature and surrounding environmental conditions of the organism. In addition, it can also shed some light as to which what parts of the sequences are conserved between different organisms, meaning that we can see which parts are actually responsible for the production of the protein (coding sequences) or which parts are just "junk" (introns, fillers, etc.).

# Methods

## Data Acquisition

The species of interest was determined by using a list of model organisms provided by Gonzolo Benegas. Three species were chosen randomly from each domain and kingdom considering the differences between each other. The NCBI Genbank Accession ID's for each species were found for the DHFR protein. The package Entrez-direct was used to populate the fasta files that included the amino acid sequence for the DHFR protein for each of the species of interest.

## Multiple Sequence Alignment

The software MUSCLE is used for Multiple Sequence Alignment for the amino acid sequences for each of the species. The method was published by Robert C. Edgar in 2004. This software was chosen because of it achieves high scores of accuracy and speed. The binary tree for alignment is constructed using neighbor-joining and then the Kimura disntace matrix (Edgar).

## Sequence Logo Visualization

Sequence logos were generated with the use of visualizing the conservation of a position in the mutliple sequence alignment. The sequence logos were generated by uploading the aligned fasta files from MUSCLE onto the web application WebLogo. This web application provides the ease of generating sequence logo without having to install dependent packages onto which WebLogo is based on the software Delila created by the Schenider Lab in UC Berkeley (Crooks).

## Phylogenetic Tree Construction

The package FastTree is used to generate maximum-liklelihood phylogenetic tree from the multiple sequence alignment generated by MUSCLE. FastTree is used because it is more accutate than PhyML and distance matrix methods because it uses the Jukes-Cantor Model. In order to visualize the tree from a newick format, the package Bio.Phylo is used to create a pyplot with the tree.

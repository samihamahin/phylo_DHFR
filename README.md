# phylo_DHFR

Create a visualization of the phylogenetic tree, multiple sequence alignment, and/or the evolution of the three-dimensional structure of the Dihydrofolate reductase protein, showing as much phylogenetic diversity as you can, illustrating any additional information you think may be useful. Your visualization can be a static image or document in PDF format (like an infographic or a poster figure), or if you prefer, it can be an interactive HTML5 webpage. Be sure to use actual data in your visualization.

*  Do we blast all of the possible sequences from all organisms or a single organism?
*  get all of the genbank accession id codes and then use entrez direct and bash commands to create fasta files
* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=DHFR
* based off of lab7: https://github.com/bioe131/lab-7-samihamahin/blob/main/assignment.ipynb -> how do we generate the fasta files, given fasta files in lab before

# phylo_DHFR

Create a visualization of the phylogenetic tree, multiple sequence alignment, and/or the evolution of the three-dimensional structure of the Dihydrofolate reductase protein, showing as much phylogenetic diversity as you can, illustrating any additional information you think may be useful. Your visualization can be a static image or document in PDF format (like an infographic or a poster figure), or if you prefer, it can be an interactive HTML5 webpage. Be sure to use actual data in your visualization.
